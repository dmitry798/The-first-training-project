# The-first-training-project
Created an information software system with a graphical interface in C++
The database (file) contains information about printed publications. For
each of them, the following are defined: name, year of publication, periodicity
(periodic or non-periodic), circulation, publisher. The program interactively generates a file, adds and deletes data, and
also perceives each of the listed requests and gives an answer to it.
1. Displays the names of all periodicals published by this publishing house.
2. Shows information about non-periodic publications with a circulation
of at least the specified number.
3. Determines the publishing house that has released the largest number of printed items in the specified year.
4. Builds a graph of the dependence of the circulation on the year for the specified periodical.
